Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.


1. Explain what a token is used for.
    A token is a highly secure format used to transmit sensitive information between two parties in a compact and self-contained manner. Tokens are often used to strengthen authentication processes, whether that be within a website or application.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?
    Use protected routes that only render with authentication.

3. Describe how web servers work.
    A web server is a computer that stores the code for a website or a program that runs on such a computer. It is connected to the internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across the world at all times. When we load the code for our websites, or web apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is "hosting" our website/app.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
